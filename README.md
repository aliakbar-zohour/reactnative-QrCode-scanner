# ðŸ“± React Native QR Code Scanner

This is a simple and lightweight React Native application that scans QR codes and displays the scanned content on the screen.

## ðŸš€ Features

- QR code scanning using the device camera
- Displays scanned content in real-time
- Minimal and clean user interface

## ðŸ›  Requirements

cd reactnative-QrCode-scanner
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server**

```bash
npx expo start
```

4. **Run the app**

## ðŸ“š Dependencies
